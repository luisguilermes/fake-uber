# Fake Uber Project

This is a study project focused on learning and experimenting with various software development concepts, 
particularly in a microservices architecture. It is not intended for production use.

## Why the name "Fake Uber"? 
This project is inspired by Uber's business model, as it presents many complex challenges related to scalability, 
distributed systems, and service orchestration. By working on this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of 
microservices, API design, event-driven architectures, and more.
